## Computer Science
[Scripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century](https://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html)
This article, while perhaps somewhat biased as well as downright incorrect when it comes to Python, made some interesting predictions that have come true.  (Python _is_ capable of macros, thought it takes a little bit more work than Lisp.)

[The Downfall of Imperative Programming.](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2012/04/the-downfall-of-imperative-programming)
This article discusses the issue of data races in concurrent programming and how they are virtually nonexistant in functional programming.  It does not preach the demise of imperative _languages._  Instead it suggests that as concurrency and parallelism become more essential, using functional techniques in imperative languages will become more critical.

[Working on The Witness, Part 11](https://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0019.html)
This article about semantic compression discusses the dramatic amount of overuse of objects in modern programming.  It also makes an excellent point about how most blog writers on the topic of programming are not highly experienced, which leads to a lot of materials teaching bad programming techniques and very little teaching the bits of wisdom learned over decades of experience.  (My personal experience confirms this.  I find so many tutorials and articles programming to a particular mathematical or organizational ideology, instead of focusing on the simplicity and elegance necessary to make efficient and maintainable software.)

[Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)
This article looks at the overuse of objects from another perspective.  If you are in love with Java or are religious in the believe that everything should be objects, this article is not for you.  Of course, if you worship objects to this degree, perhaps there is no point in reading _any_ of these articles...


## Mathematics
[Why Japanese Multiplication Works](https://tapintoteenminds.com/japanese-multiplication/)
Excellent article explaining the line multiplication method taught in Japanese schools.  U.S. schools should really adopt this method.


## Chemistry

[Things I Wonâ€™t Work With: Dioxygen Difluoride](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride)
Perhaps one of my most favorite articles ever.  You should read this, because the phrase "Satan's kimchi" features in it.  Also, the comments are very much worth reading as well.
