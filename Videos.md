## Biohacking

[Biohacking - the forefront of a new kind of human evolution: Amal Graafstra at TEDxSFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DxVWhFLI6E)</br>
This TEDx talk is an excellent introduction to biohacking.  It starts with practical applications and then goes into more experimental stuff and some of the potential pitfalls.

[My experience with bio-hacking | Martin Kremmer | TEDxCopenhagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADyCY382lAY)
This TEDx talk discusses medical biohacking, as a way to take control of your own health and to personalize your healthcare instead of relying on a medical system designed for averages rather than individuals.

## Programming

[Debugging and the Art of Avoiding Bugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfrnU3-EpPI)
This is a fascinating video discussing how to debug, avoid bugs, and program in ways that make debugging much easier.  It's C oriented, but a lot of it applies more generically regardless of programming language.  I once read an article lamenting the lack of highly experienced programmers producing content on how to program well.  This is an example of such a programmer, and his other videos appear to be of similar value.

## Prime Numbers

[Exploring the mysteries of the Prime (gaps!) Line.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsTXQYgbiQ)
Stand-up Maths video on (surprise) prime numbers.  This includes a log frequency graph of gap sizes between primes that's very interesting.  It also discusses an interesting relationship between prime gaps and primorals.

## Electronics

[How to Achieve Proper Grounding - Rick Hartley - Expert Live Training (US)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySuUZEjARPY)
As it says, this is an _expert_ level training on electrical grounding, mainly with reference to PCBs.  This is especially interesting in terms of RF and other extremely high frequency signals, where grounding works _extremely_ differently from how it works with DC and lower frequency AC signals.  This is an incredibly valuable training for anyone working with PCBs or other circuitry with AC signals above audio frequency (above roughly ~10kHz this stuff starts to matter).  There's also some good discussion here on mixed voltage and mutlilayer boards and how to do good grounding for those, especially when signals need to cross voltage level boundaries or travel between layers.

## Nutrition

[10,000 Years Ago We Stopped Eating This and It Was a Huge Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyFHZLI7ME)
This video looks at the evolution of human diet, starting with evolutionary ancestors.  The interesting part though, is about the variablity human dietary needs.  It also briefly mentions the role of gut biome in things like insulin response.  Probably worth a deeper dive into some of the topics discussed in the video.
